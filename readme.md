# Physics World Simulation 🌍  

#### This project demonstrates how to create an interactive physics simulation using Three.js. By pairing visual meshes with physics counterparts, you can simulate real-world interactions such as collisions, sliding, and falling in a seamless and visually appealing way. Perfect for developers interested in combining Three.js visuals with physics-based motion.

## 🌟 Key Features  

### 🌌 Invisible Physics World  
#### Objects in the physics world follow realistic principles such as gravity, collision, and friction, creating lifelike interactions.

### 🎮 Real-Time Synchronization  
#### Visual meshes in Three.js are dynamically updated each frame to reflect the physics world's calculations.

### 🔄 Simple Object Integration  
#### Add spheres, boxes, or other shapes to both the Three.js scene and the physics simulation with minimal setup.  

### 💻 Modular and Extendable Design  
#### Code is structured to allow easy expansion, accommodating more complex physics interactions as needed.
